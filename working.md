Based on your project requirements and the issues you've encountered, here's a comprehensive plan to implement the desired functionality in your Next.js application:

---

## ‚úÖ Project Overview

Your application aims to:

1. **Landing Page**: Provide options to either find or upload study resources.

2. **Find Resources**:

   * Allow users to select filters (college, course, semester, subject).
   * Search for matching resources stored in Google Drive.
   * Display available PDFs with options to view or download.
   * Prompt users to log in before downloading.

3. **Upload Resources**:

   * Require user authentication.
   * Allow users to upload resources to a structured folder path in Google Drive.
   * Store metadata in Supabase.
   * Track the number of unique downloads per resource.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

### 1. **Landing Page (`/`)**

* **Components**:

  * Buttons to navigate to "Find Resources" and "Upload Resource" pages.

* **Routing**:

  * Use Next.js `Link` component to navigate to `/resources` and `/upload`.

### 2. **Find Resources Page (`/resources`)**

* **Form**:

  * Dropdowns for college, course, semester, and subject.
  * "Search Resources" button.([Google for Developers][1])

* **Functionality**:

  * On form submission, send a POST request to `/api/resources` with selected filters.
  * Display a list of matching resources with options to view or download.
  * If no resources are found, display a message encouraging users to upload.

* **Authentication**:

  * Allow viewing resources without login.
  * Require login for downloading resources.([Google for Developers][2])

### 3. **Upload Resource Page (`/upload`)**

* **Authentication**:

  * Require users to log in before accessing the upload form.
  * Use Firebase Authentication for user management.

* **Form**:

  * Fields for title, college, course, semester, subject.
  * File upload input.
  * "Upload Resource" button.([Teco Tutorials][3])

* **Functionality**:

  * On form submission, send a POST request to `/api/upload` with form data and file.
  * Upload the file to Google Drive in the appropriate folder path.
  * Store metadata in Supabase, including an initial download count of 0.

## üß© API Routes

### 1. **Upload Resource (`/api/upload`)**

* **Method**: POST

* **Functionality**:

  * Parse multipart/form-data using `formidable`.
  * Authenticate with Google Drive API using service account credentials.
  * Create folder hierarchy in Google Drive if it doesn't exist.
  * Upload the file to the appropriate folder.
  * Store metadata in Supabase, including title, college, course, semester, subject, drive link, uploader ID, and download count.([CoderSteps][4])

* **Note**: Ensure that the service account has the necessary permissions to access and modify the specified Google Drive folders.

### 2. **Find Resources (`/api/resources`)**

* **Method**: POST

* **Functionality**:

  * Receive filters (college, course, semester, subject) from the request body.
  * Query Supabase for resources matching the filters.
  * Return a list of matching resources, including title, drive link, and download count.([Google for Developers][1])

---

## üîê Authentication

* **Firebase Authentication**:

  * Implement sign-up and login functionality using Firebase Authentication.
  * Send email verification upon sign-up.
  * Restrict access to the upload page for authenticated and verified users only.

---

## üìà Tracking Downloads

* **Download Count**:

  * When a user downloads a resource, send a POST request to `/api/download` with the resource ID.
  * In the API route, increment the download count for the resource in Supabase.
  * Ensure that only unique downloads are counted (e.g., by tracking user IDs or IP addresses).

* **Uploader Dashboard**:

  * Create a dashboard page (`/dashboard`) accessible only to authenticated users.
  * Display a list of resources uploaded by the user along with their respective download counts.

---

## üìù Additional Pages

* **Sign Up (`/signup`)**:

  * Form for creating a new account.
  * Fields: name, email, password.
  * Send email verification upon successful sign-up.

* **Login (`/login`)**:

  * Form for existing users to log in.
  * Fields: email, password.

* **Dashboard (`/dashboard`)**:

  * Accessible only to authenticated users.
  * Display a list of resources uploaded by the user.
  * Show download counts for each resource.

---

## üîß Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set:

* **Supabase**:

  * `SUPABASE_URL`
  * `SUPABASE_KEY`

* **Google Drive API**:

  * `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` (JSON string of the service account credentials)

* **Firebase**:

  * `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
  * `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
  * `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
  * `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
  * `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
  * `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

---

## üß™ Testing

* **Upload Flow**:

  * Test uploading resources with various combinations of college, course, semester, and subject.
  * Verify that the folder structure is correctly created in Google Drive.
  * Ensure that metadata is accurately stored in Supabase.

* **Find Resources Flow**:

  * Test searching for resources using different filters.
  * Verify that the correct resources are displayed.
  * Ensure that the download functionality works as expected, including authentication checks.

* **Download Tracking**:

  * Download a resource multiple times and verify that the download count increments appropriately.
  * Ensure that only unique downloads are counted.

* **Authentication**:

  * Test sign-up, email verification, login, and access restrictions for the upload page and dashboard.
